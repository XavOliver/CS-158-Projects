        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Background:</p>
        
        <p>Skills: During my high-school years I became familiar with and able to efficiently operate Microsoft Office programs such as Word and PowerPoint.
            I also learned the fundamentals of IT and Cybersecurity, and learned how to code in both C# and Python.
            During my senior year of high-school I earned my Python certification through Certiport, and my ITF+ Certification through CompTIA.
            In my freshman year of college I learned how to code in C++ and JavaScript,
            along with HTML and CSS. Having done multiple group assignments,
            I've shown the capabilities to effectively work in a team, and to apply constructive criticism I've been given.</p>

        <p>Goals: After graduating from Jacksonville University with my Bachelor’s 
            degree in Game Design, I’d probably start making my games available on itch.io,
            a site built for indie developers to get themselves out there. Eventually,
            I’d like to be able to offer my games on Steam and current gen consoles,
            like the PlayStation and Xbox. Since my main career will be heavily focused on technology and internet services,
            I also plan on minoring in Cybersecurity. As with Game Design,
            I plan on working on campus to build up funds and pursuing internship opportunities.
            I’d use my gained skills and knowledge in the field to bolster my personal security and the security of my games.
            I may also do some ethical hacking on the side if I have no current projects going on, or I need to build up more funds.
            All these accumulated funds from Game Design and Cybersecurity would go toward high-end monitors, laptops, PC components,
            and any other accessories I may want to create the optimal environment for my career to flourish.</p>
